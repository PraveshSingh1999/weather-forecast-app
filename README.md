-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a Weather Forecast Application designed in React JS and Tailwind
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two APIs are Used-
- First API is for fetching city data.
- Second API is for fetching weather data based on a particular city's Latitude and Longitude.

- On the city Table, the Infinite Scrolling feature is implemented.
- I also designed logos and icons for this application using Adobe Illustrator Tool.
